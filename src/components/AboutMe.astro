      Hi, I’m Angello Nunez — a passionate software engineering student at Western Governors University with a love for building innovative web and mobile applications. I have been living in the USA for more than 5 years. <strong>I thrive at the intersection of creativity and technology</strong>, constantly exploring new ways to bring ideas to life through code.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a content creator, I run a YouTube channel where I <strong>simplify complex tech topics through visual, easy-to-understand explanations — making learning accessible to everyone</strong>. I’m also an entrepreneur at heart, having founded two companies: Zelandaware, focused on software solutions, and Emprezus, a Spanish-language educational platform for entrepreneurs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether it’s designing intuitive apps, solving real-world problems with technology, or taking on new challenges, I’m driven by <strong>curiosity and a desire to make a meaningful impact through software</strong>.
    </p>
